# DreamTeamcoding
Dream Team coding has created something that will change college preregistration forever, one of the most wide spread reason for college students not graduating on time is because they did not sign up for the correct classes. 
Dream Team coding has created "APOS", Automated Pan of Study. Using APOS will allow students to easily find thier major and concentration.
The student then chooses courses that they have already taken (best to have chosenchosenchosenchoosen transcript handy).
once the all courses are chosen our sowftwear reads our data and compars it to our datase of class and grenerates a list of classes you should take in the up coming semester
